   speech.mjs — A MOUTH THAT IS MAKING THE SOUND YOU ARE HEARING.

   THE COMPLAINT THIS ANSWERS: "we don't see a mouth talking." Twelve people
   speak in this film for three minutes and eleven seconds and not one visible
   mouth ever opens. The voice arrives from somewhere beside the picture.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, which is the only real idea in this file.

       THE WAVEFORM DECIDES *IF* THE MOUTH IS OPEN.
       THE TEXT DECIDES *WHAT SHAPE* IT IS IN.

   Every lip-sync failure is one of these two doing the other's job.

   Drive a mouth from text alone (the usual approach: spell the line, allocate
   the syllables evenly, animate) and it flaps through pauses, breaths and the
   half-second before a sentence starts. The tell is unmistakable — a mouth
   moving in silence — and it is why cheap lip-sync reads as a puppet rather
   than a speaker.

   Drive it from the envelope alone and you get a hinge. Loud/quiet is a single
   channel; it cannot tell an /ee/ from an /oo/, and it never closes on an /m/,
   because the voice does not stop during a bilabial — the lips do. A hinged jaw
   opening in time with the volume is legible as "sound is happening near this
   head", not as "this head is saying these words."

   So: the recorded RMS envelope gates, and the spelled line shapes. And the
   gate is a FLOOR, not a mask — if the envelope is loud where the text expects
   a rest (which happens whenever the timing drifts), the mouth opens anyway, on
   a neutral shape. Drift then costs articulation, which is a blur. The other
   arrangement costs closure, which is a lie.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   TEN VISEMES, not forty phonemes.

   At 12fps a frame is 83ms — about one phoneme. There is no budget for
   distinctions the frame rate cannot carry, and a finer set would only produce
   shapes the dot lattice quantises away. These are the reduced set that
   animation has used since Preston Blair, chosen because each is a distinct
   SILHOUETTE and this world has nothing but silhouette:

     REST  closed, neutral            MM  pressed shut       (m b p)
     AH    wide and tall              EE  wide and narrow    (i e y)
     OH    rounded, medium            OO  tight, protruded   (u w oo)
     FF    lower lip to teeth (f v)   TH  tongue at the teeth
     DD    small, tongue up (t d n l) SS  narrow, teeth close (s z sh ch)

   Grapheme rules, not a pronunciation dictionary. English spelling is a bad
   guide to English sound and this WILL mis-shape words like "though". It is
   the right trade at this scale: a wrong-but-plausible shape inside a correctly
   gated aperture is invisible, and a dictionary would buy accuracy the lattice
   discards. Where it matters — the closures — spelling is reliable: m, b and p
   are bilabial in every English word without exception.

   PURE. No clock, no state. Every export is a function of its arguments, so a
   frame renders identically whether or not the frame before it ever existed.

   The whole engine, in one call.

   COARTICULATION. A viseme is not reached instantly and is not held to its
   boundary: a real articulator is already moving toward the next shape while
   it finishes the last. So the returned channels are a weighted blend of every
   viseme within BLEND seconds of t, under a triangular kernel. Without this,
   at 12fps, the mouth teleports between shapes once per frame and strobes.
   BLEND is 110ms — a little over one frame, which is roughly how long a jaw
   takes to travel.

   THE GATE, and the one asymmetry that matters:

     jaw = max( visemeJaw * gate ,  FLOOR * gate )

   The first term is the articulated shape. The second is the floor: whenever
   the recording is loud, SOMETHING opens, even if the text thinks we are
   between words. Drift then shows up as a vaguer shape rather than as a closed
   mouth over a loud syllable. And `press` — the bilabial closure — multiplies
   the whole thing down afterwards, because an /m/ is silent at the lips while
   the voice continues: that closure must survive a loud envelope or the film
   never closes a mouth at all. */

   A head does not hold still while its owner talks, and a speaking face that
   holds still is the second-worst tell after a mouth flapping in silence.

   These are small, derived from the SAME envelope, and deliberately lagged: the
   head follows the voice, it does not lead it. Amounts are in the units the
   face module wants (fractions of head radius, radians), and all of them are
   under two per cent of the frame — liveness.mjs' own finding, "you should not
   be able to point at the motion."

   because a person is emphasising something and a head nodding because it is
